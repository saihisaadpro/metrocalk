# Progress

## Now
- **M1 complete + hardened.** All deliverables verified; M1.6 pipeline-hardening pass closed four audit gaps (precise additive-undo, atomic pre-validated commit, O(1) `tid→eid`, Loro-error propagation) before M2 builds on the pipeline — see Done below.

## Next (milestone M2)
- **Carry-forward (later):** getrandom `js` for Loro-in-browser + the Phase-2 pure-Rust query backend (ADR-006); real-scene render cost @ ≥5k entities (M2 stress scene); Tauri WebView2 IPC (M2 gate).
- **Carry-forward (Phase 2, with collab):** `merge()` rebuilds entities from Loro but **not their ECS tags/pairs** — capabilities are ECS-only, never written to Loro, so the **compatibility query is empty after a merge**. Fix wires the registry (component-kind → capabilities) into `rebuild_ecs_from_loro`; schedule with collab. (Surfaced by M1.6 audit; see `progress/M1.md`.)

## Done (milestone-level)
- Pre-M0: feasibility plan v2 (locked stack), research sweep (~30 sources), doc structure + ADRs 001–005 + Opus 4.8 prompt set.
- **M0 complete (2026-06-13):** 3 spikes — ① Loro ADOPT, ② Flecs ADOPT, ③ wasm/WebGPU browser-render PROVEN + CI tripwire live — and the gate review. New decision: ADR-006 (browser query backend). Detail → `progress/M0.md`, consolidation → `M0-gate-review.md`.
- **M1 complete (M1.1–M1.5 + M1–2 + M1.6, 2026-06-13):** monorepo + CI · ECS `World` wrapper + Flecs backend · component-metadata registry · shared seeded stress-scene + F1 storage verdict (keep dense) · 16 ms compat-query CI perf gate (3rd CI tripwire) · **ECS↔Loro commit pipeline + engine-side undo/redo + merge-validation (M1–2)** · **pipeline hardening (M1.6)**: precise additive-undo (`Op::RemoveField` — no more sibling-field destruction), atomic pre-validated commit (all-or-nothing), O(1) `tid→eid`, Loro-error propagation in `apply_*`. **flecs_ecs M1 go/no-go: GO** — undo p99 0.24–0.72 ms (≫ under the 5 ms target), resurrection robust, two-fork merge converges, all 8 invalid-state classes detected+repaired, 49 tests green. Detail → `progress/M1.md`.

Detailed dated entries are sharded by milestone under `progress/` (keeps this dashboard thin).
Append to the **current milestone's** file, newest first, one entry per session, with measured
